I'm a PHP Backend Developer. I like to do programming and I do lots of research everyday to fulfill my never ending curiousity thurst. Always grind my skill sets to see myself at a better position. So I try my best to update my skills as per trending upgradation.I also revise my previous projects, test their efficiency and update them on regular basis.

Worked as a PHP developer over the years.Currently, at my company, my task is to create and maintain Shopify apps for merchants in collaboration with the REST admin API and GraphQL of Shopify. My interest is growing toward an Advanced Database Engineering career.

Past two years I have completed several web applications using (PHP,HTML,CSS,JS,JQuery,REST API,GraphQL) and developed some advanced android apps (JAVA).
